I built an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore Sales sample dataset from Tableau Public to practice and sharpen my data visualization skills. The dashboard highlights U.S. sales performance with state-level order distribution, order trends and forecasts, and category breakdowns by year.

I have demonstrated the following skills through this practice project:

- Visualization design – Built interactive maps, trend lines with forecasts, and category pie charts.
- Geospatial mapping – Displayed state-level sales with dynamic labels and color gradients.
- Forecasting – Applied Tableau’s time-series forecasting for sales projections.
- Interactivity – Added filters, tooltips, and parameters for user-driven exploration.
- Data storytelling – Combined visuals into a cohesive dashboard to highlight key insights.
